The long-term, more extensive projects are denoted by *'s, shorter term ones are denoted by %'s.
When I accomplish something of note, I write a + line. These lines are reset daily.

* Build empathic machine general intelligence
* Help myself and others better understand the nuanced, complex world we live in
