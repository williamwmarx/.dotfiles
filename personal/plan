This is my daily work, these are the projects I'm working on...

The long-term, more extensive projects are denoted by *'s, shorter term ones are denoted by %'s.
When I accomplish something of note, I write a + line. These lines are reset daily.

Missed a couple days. Working on some things I can't talk about yet...

* Build empathic machine general intelligence
* Help myself and others better understand the nuanced, complex world we live in
* Investigate the learned biases of ML models and craft their solutions
* Clarify and model the state of labor in America
