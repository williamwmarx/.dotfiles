## Packages ðŸ“¦

The install command is not a package manager, it merely leverages your systemâ€™s package manager,
whether it be `apt`, `homebrew`, `dnf`, or `pacman`. It can also run install scripts for packages
not in the above indices.

All packages available to install are located in the [packages.toml](packages.toml) file. Packages
are grouped into lists to be installed together. In the TOML file, packages and package groups are
initialized as tables (`[package_group.packages.package_name]`). Each package should have a `name`
key to display when installing the package, as well as `description` and `url` keys to assist in
building this README. Other possible keys for each package are `apt_name`, `brew_name`,
`brew_cask_name`, `dnf_name`, `pacman_name`, and `install_command`.
